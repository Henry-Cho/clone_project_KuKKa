## 🔧 Features and Collaboration tools (Front-end)

---

### [Login & Signup pages]

- We used Axios in order to commune with the server & to enable authorization through receiving & sending JWT tokens when it comes to signup & login.

### [Main page]

- We also used Axios to get the JSON data, which has the entire info of the flower bouquets so that we can display all of the items on our main page (UseEffect).
- When hovering the mouse on each item, we added animation that increases its scale a little bit.
- When clicking each item, we gained its unique id so that we can link it to a new page (history. push("/detail/:id")), which contains the item's information.

### [Product detail page]

- With the usage of Axios, we made it possible to load a page in accordance with a specific item's info (UseEffect). Moreover, I added the comment function operated with the start rating feature.

### [Overall UI]

- We used styled-components and material-ui.

### ⚒ Collaboration tool
